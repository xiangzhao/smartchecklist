Smart Checklist Group Meeting - Wed. Nov. 13, 2013
===================================================

Attendees: Julian, Victoria (resident), Jeff (MDPnP SW Eng), Diego (MDPnP SW Eng), Steven (Docbox Biomed Eng),
           Lee, Lori, George, Stefan, Heather, Lizzy

Process modeling:
----------------
* (DONE) Rename "assess patient hazards" as "assess infusion-related hazards"
* Categorize artifacts by source (e.g., EMR, electronic order entry system, paper, ...)
* May want to elaborate "assess infusion-related hazards" and "perform baseline assessment test" based on contraindications
	- If there are hazards, then could use reactions to ensure that certain follow up is performed in a timely manner
* There are two common ways to set the pump settings
	1) (set pump settings; confirm pump settings)+; start pump
	2) set pump settings (with approximate values); confirm pump settings; start pump; 
	   set pump settings (with concrete values)
	   // Could add an annotation to document the approximate values

GUI:
---

Patient info panel:
* LEFT - Add gender, weight
	- For infusion therapy, add allergies (one of not entered, none, or itemized list)
* RIGHT - Could add monitor info (either streaming vitals or Dave's summary view)

Activities:
* Filter the activities as you would a task or TODO list
* Add a complete button to a non-leaf that when pressed batch performs its leaves  
* For an activity that interacts with a device (e.g. enter pump settings),
  have that activity include an image of that device
* Shrink leaf activities that have already been performed  
* How to clearly show relationships among activities
	- Possibly thicken the border of the non-leaf activities that depicts the composition
  	  of the activities (but that could clutter the view)
	- Sequencing:
		* For a parallel step p, could have its activity title be s (perform the following in any order)
		* For a choice step c, could have its activity title be c (select one among the following)
	- Consider how to show priorities among the activities

Notes:
* Notes and tooltip views are too similar to each other

Timestamps:
* Store timestamps for posted, started, and finished
	- For now, only show finished
	
Documentation:
* Automatically generate a process report (include historical data such as timestamps)

Artifacts:
* Add a MedicalDevice interface with methods: getName, getUID, getImage
	- Any human performer that uses a medical device can then be shown the image
* MDPnP could give us access to the following
	- EHR data from DOD
	- Streaming data from devices

Evaluation plan:
---

1) In parallel, iteratively refine the process model and incrementally build the GUI
2) Have Julian review the process model
3) Get feedback from focus group of domain experts - Feb. 2014
 	a) Need at least two months notice for domain experts
