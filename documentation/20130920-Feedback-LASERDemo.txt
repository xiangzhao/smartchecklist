Smart Checklist GUI Demo - Friday 9/20/2013
===================================

FIRST:

- History
	- (DONE) Add a legend for the colors
	- Preferences for colors
	- Keep in mind color blindness
	- Ask Jenna's for her suggestions
	- Also use textures (?)

- Names
	- (DONE) Keep stable - don't move because of buttons or timestamps
	- Allow wrap (?)

- Buttons
	- (DONE) Consider different orders of the buttons (all together to the left/right side: complete, notes, failed)
	- For a single exception, don't bring up the dialog box simply throw that exception.
	- (DONE) If activity is cancelled, then remove complete button // Rethink color

- ActivityPanel
	- Group panel use more common arrows (not ones used now)
	- Leaves: Shrink the size after finished (Concept of fish eye lens); Non-Leaves: Do not collapse

- Hierarchy
	- Option for whether to show only leaves or non-leaves/leaves
	- (FIXED) BUG: Inner group panel collapse needs to reclaim space

- Timestamps
	- Non-leaf steps too

---------------------------------------------------

SECOND:

- Process
	- Access to glossary for novices
	- (DONE) Show execution state: posted, started, finished (completed, failed); Possibilities are:
		- Tab color
		- Add timestamp
		- (TO BE FURTHER DUSCUSSED) After finished, collapse panel

- Add descriptions
	- (DONE) Inputs and outputs: Show types (and values)
	- Overview for novices

- Hierarchy
	- Allow user to annotate non-leaves with whether to include/exclude

- Timestamps
	- Add clock time to upper left/right corner
	- Preferences for timestamps (show/hide)
	- Which ones to log: posted, started, finished (completed, failed)
	- Sort by the timestamps
	- Warning count down/up timers

- (DONE) Artifacts:
	- Case 1: List inputs and outputs similar to how the narrator does; Show types (and values)
	- Case 2: External dialog box to enter outputs // Not the Smart Checklist's responsibility

---------------------------------------------------

FUTURE WORK: 
	Beth mentioned could also help team coordination (others can view) as opposed to single agent checklist (only agent can view). 
	She also says show only the "important" activities and problems that occurred.

	Lee - For each step, are there a list of common notes to select from?
