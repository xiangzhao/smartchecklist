MockUp Feedback - LASER Meeting - Friday September 27, 2013
===========================================================

Current Work:

* The favorite was left buttons and right status indicator (4.3)

* (DONE) Step name
    * Should be the leftmost component
        * There could possibly be a small status indicator before the step name
    * Should be aligned with the other step names 

* Finish actions (i.e. optout, complete, terminate)
    * Could switch from push buttons to radio buttons
    * (DONE) Should more clearly differentiate the buttons from the status indicators
    * (REJECTED) Change the text color instead of the background color

* Notes
    * (DONE) Note "model":
        * Medical records usually only allow additions and not removals.
        * Each note should be annotated with the following:
            * Author
	    * Timestamp
	    * Activity (?)
    * (DONE) Note "view":
        * Differentiate between being able to read/write versus only read
    * Can Little-JIL steps modify their artifacts after they have finished (i.e. opted out, completed, terminated)?

* Problem(s)
    * (DONE) Show the problems as a tooltip, list/tree, in the notes, ...
    * Link the reporting and recovery of the problems

Future Work:

* Provide support to dictate the notes
