Notes from Smart Checklist demo, LASER meeting 2013-10-11

(DONE) Combine/merge two views:
	- the columns from the table-tree view are nice
	- the indentation (including indentation of color boxes) from the PGroup view is nice

(DONE) Note button:
	- have different icon for notes -- read-only, write-only, note icon that shows if something has been written
	- show note upon mouse hover
	- open note dialog box close to the note button
	- enable note button on finished steps (for now, keep it editable)

(DONE) Parallel process example:
	- add exceptions for next Friday

(DONE) Legend:
	- align text
	- "Deactivated" or "withdrawn" (no need to say "elsewhere ...") for canceled steps

(DONE) Other:
	- makes the Xs for status indicator and fail button the same shape
	- if possible, make the height of activity panels smaller, so that more activities will fit on the screen
	- make the background color of all panels in the activity panel the same (maybe we can have a debugging flag that allows us to show different background colors in debugging mode)

User preferences:
	- whether to automatically collapse finished steps

Longer term questions/issues:
	- how to show things done by different agents
	- (REJECTED) for table tree view
		- issue: time stamp on sub steps or just higher-level step
