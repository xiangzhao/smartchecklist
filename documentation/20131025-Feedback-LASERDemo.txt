Notes from Smart Checklist demo, LASER meeting 2013-10-25
=========================================================

Current Work
------------

PROCESS:
    - (DONE) Add process status indicator (e.g., icons, progress bar)
	- Could collapse the process panel after finished

ACTIVITY:
    - Computing layout for long step names
    	- Could scale, wrap, elide then use tooltip, short names vs. long names
	- (DONE) show the alternative the agent selected at a decision point
	- (DONE) show the exception/problem that occurred
	- simple annotation to decide which intermediate steps to show
	- (DONE) remove buttons after activity finishes
    
(DONE) NOTES: 
	- (DONE) Make text of notes different from note title
	- (DONE) Carefully consider how right indentation affects note button alignment

ARTIFACTS:
	- (DONE, simple cases) Support three cases: input/output lists (like narrator), decision node, form-based
	
(DONE) PROCESS EXAMPLE:
	- (DONE) Find example of parallelism and/or shuffle
	- (DONE) Add it to the process definition, make it executable

Future Work
-----------

UNDO: Clicked on wrong button
	- One step undo
		* maybe put something on the time stamp of the last finished step
		* maybe make step status indicator of only last finished step in color (e.g., green, red), rest grayscale (e.g., dark grey)
		* add support for going to last finished step
	- "Invisible exception" (mechanism for making undo work with interpreter)
