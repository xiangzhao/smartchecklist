Feedback from George, Lori, and Lee 2013-11-06
===================================

Process model
-------------

* Shuffle
  - Parallel versus iterative choice
  - (DONE) At least one substep should throw an exception and then have a handler for that exception

* Human performer interactions with automated agents
  - Consider different models and views: Should have steps for human performer and automated agent

GUI
---

Current work:

* (DONE) Process status indicator
  - Move to the right side
  - Add timestamp
  - Mouse over brings up tooltip
  - Create a separate widget for the status indicator image(s) and tooltip.

* Activities
  - Reduce size of leaf activity panels that have finished (or give an option to user to make them thinner)
  - Add activity status indicator and notes for non-leaf activity panels

* Artifacts
  - (DONE, simple case) Show inputs: Add icon, Mouse over brings up tooltip
  - (DONE) After infusion pump GUI is opened, leave it open
  - Communication steps could have a message template (See Camille's work)
    - e.g., "contact doctor for new treatment" step

 Future work:

* Shuffle
  - Could show each substep once; It does not have to show retractions and reposts of that substep
  
* For now, past and current steps shown
  - Future steps should be shown too

* For now, the smart checklist supports single agent with a single process
  - Single agent with multiple processes (e.g, patient or nurse)
  - Multiple agents with a single process (e.g., blood transfusion, UCSF)
